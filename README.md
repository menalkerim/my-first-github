My name is Menalkerim Abduljebar Mahammed, and
I am delighted to have the opportunity to apply for the Thomas More Exchange Program. 
Growing up in the small village of Limu Shaye, I have faced numerous challenges due to my family's financial limitations. However, my parents' unwavering commitment to education instilled in me a deep appreciation for learning and a desire to overcome obstacles. 
Today, I stand before you as a resilient individual who is eager to make the most out of life's opportunities.
